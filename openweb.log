I have been a valuable team player at every project I have done caused my pragmatic way of working. Starting at Open Web was an easy choice for me because it's an environment where I can learn a lot from my fellow colleagues and also have the opportunity to build a really small company from the ground up. Being able to share knowledge between such a close group of coworkers has been the main reason for me to start at Open Web.\\nI love puzzles of any kind and trying to find a clever way to solve them. This is reflected in how I write Javacode, but also in my personal life where I love to play any kind of game. When I am not busy trying to demolish other people with board games, I act on stage with my own theater company or I read fantasy novels.",
